Pixel wise matching with queried material: The broad class and specif#ic material within that class is taken as input. Corresponding
to the central wavelengths of the bands of the test image, a vector with the corresonding nearest neighbour wavelengths of the
queried material is determined. For each pixel, the squared error between the image band reflectances and the reflectances for the
nearest neighbour wavelength vector is determined. This error is tested against the threshold for appropriate classification.
